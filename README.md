# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```




***If after installing the repository in your local environment, the app doesnâ€™t run, please follow this guidance*****

First try:

   Clear the Node Modules and Reinstall Packages:

         rm -rf node_modules
         rm package-lock.json # or yarn.lock if using Yarn
         npm install
         # or
         yarn install


Second:
   Try install metro as a Dependency:

         npm install metro --save
         # or
         yarn add metro


Third:   
   Update Expo CLI:

         npm install -g expo-cli

Fourth: 

	Check for Compatibility Issues:
         There could be a version mismatch between expo and metro. Make sure your expo, metro, and related dependencies are compatible:
               Run npm outdated to check for outdated packages.
               Update packages accordingly.

Fifth: 
	Rebuild Your Expo Cache:
         expo start -c

sixth : 
	Ensure the Correct Node.js Version:
         nvm install 18 # Current LTS 18.12.0
         nvm use 18


***After following all these steps your local environment should be ready to go***


In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).






## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
